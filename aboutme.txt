Title: The Last Train Home unini
---

The wind howled through the empty train station as Maya clutched her coat tighter. She glanced at her watch—11:45 PM. The last train home was due any minute, and the platform was deserted except for a flickering light overhead. The day had been long, filled with meetings and deadlines, and all she wanted was to sink into her bed.

A faint sound of footsteps broke the silence. Maya turned and saw a man, perhaps in his sixties, standing at the far end of the platform. He smiled softly, his eyes tired but kind.

“Waiting for the last train too?” he asked.

She nodded. “Yeah, it’s been a long day.”

He chuckled. “Funny how we all seem to race against time, yet we always end up here, just... waiting.”

Before Maya could respond, the train’s headlights pierced the darkness, its brakes screeching to a halt. The doors slid open with a metallic groan. She stepped inside, looking back to see if the man would follow. But the platform was empty.

Confused, she peered out of the window. The man was gone, as if he'd never been there. The train pulled away, and in the distance, she noticed an old, faded poster on the platform wall. It showed a picture of the same man, with the words: In Memory of Thomas Reed — Station Master, 1963-1992.

A chill ran down her spine. The wind whispered through the cracks, but the train carried her home, safely through the night.
