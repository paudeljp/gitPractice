# My Story

Tom, a mischievous cat, and Jerry, a clever little mouse, lived in the same house. Their days were filled with endless chases and tricks, with Tom always trying to catch Jerry, but never quite succeeding. Jerry, small but quick-witted, would outsmart Tom every time—squeezing through small gaps, setting up traps, and using Tom’s own plans against him.

One day, Tom devised a foolproof plan. He set out the tastiest piece of cheese in the middle of the kitchen, hoping to lure Jerry into a trap. Jerry, eyeing the cheese suspiciously, knew something was up. He carefully examined the room and noticed the trap hidden beneath the floorboard. Smiling to himself, Jerry knocked over a broom, causing it to fall and release the trap prematurely.

Tom, hearing the noise, rushed in, only to find himself tangled up in his own trap! As he struggled to free himself, Jerry casually walked over, grabbed the cheese, and gave Tom a cheeky wave before darting back to his hole.

Though Tom never caught Jerry, deep down, they both enjoyed their playful rivalry. Their days continued, full of pranks and laughter—each secretly appreciating the other's cleverness.
